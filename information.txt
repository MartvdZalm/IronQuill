 *  To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window
 *  will cover.  If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode.
 *  Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is
 *  recommended that you pick the primary monitor.  For more information on how
 *  to query connected monitors, see @ref monitor_monitors.
